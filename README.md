## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm a senior backend developer with a strong focus on designing and building scalable microservices and APIs. My core stack revolves around Spring Boot for building robust backend services, and Apache Kafka for enabling real-time communication and event-driven architectures.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked on distributed systems that power mission-critical applications, handling everything from API design and service orchestration to message streaming and data consistency. Iâ€™m passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and building systems that are both resilient and easy to scale.

This repository showcases some of the work Iâ€™ve done or the patterns I use frequently in real-world projects. Youâ€™ll find examples of microservices architecture, Kafka producers and consumers, RESTful APIs, service discovery, configuration management, and more. I also explore areas like testing strategies, monitoring, and containerization to support production-grade deployments.

Spring Boot and Kafka are powerful tools when used together, and I enjoy leveraging their strengths to create services that communicate efficiently, handle high throughput, and remain decoupled. Whether it's building synchronous APIs or asynchronous event-driven flows, I aim to create backend systems that are reliable and responsive.

I believe in sharing knowledge and learning from others in the community. This space is not just for showcasing codeâ€”it's a way to exchange ideas, try new concepts, and push the boundaries of what backend systems can do. If you're a fellow developer, architect, or just curious about microservices and messaging systems, I hope you find something valuable here.

Thanks for visiting. Feel free to explore the code, open an issue, or start a conversation. Letâ€™s build better backend systemsâ€”one service at a time.
